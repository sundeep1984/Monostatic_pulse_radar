# Monostatic_pulse_radar
Design and simulation of a basic monostatic pulse radar system

This program designs and simulates a simple monostatic pulse radar system. The design is based on the one given at https://www.mathworks.com/help/phased/examples/designing-a-basic-monostatic-pulse-radar.html?requestedDomain=www.mathworks.com

Some simplifying assumptions have been made in the simulation regarding the propagation model and the receiver design.
